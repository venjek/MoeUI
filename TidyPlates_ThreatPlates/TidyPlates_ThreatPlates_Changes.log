------------------------------------------------------
8.1.4 (works with TidyPlates 6.18.6)
------------------------------------------------------
* Basic compatibility with TidyPlates 6.18.6 - some things may still be broken (probably changing options without reload UI)
* Added holy power as combo points for retribution paladins
* Fixed a bug with the class icon being displayed despite unit being hidden (e.g. normal or boss units)

------------------------------------------------------
8.1.3 (works with TidyPlates 6.18.3)
------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug with class coloring for players used although not enabled

------------------------------------------------------
8.1.2 (works with TidyPlates 6.18.3)
------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a typo in enUS localization

------------------------------------------------------
8.1.1 (works with TidyPlates 6.18.3)
------------------------------------------------------
* Reworked the settings for coloring the healthbar according to the priority in which the settings are applied, also: fixed some bugs
* Fixed several bugs regarding tapped units (coloring, scaling, alpha, etc.)
* Fixed a bug with nameplate coloring when units change factions (e.g., in Suramar)
* Fixed several bugs with headline view (alpha, apply changes without reload UI)
* Localization fixes (consistant naming of tapped units, deDE)

------------------------------------------------------
8.1 (works with TidyPlates 6.18.3)
------------------------------------------------------
* Updated addon for Legion (7.0.3): added the demonhunter class, updated several spells (e.g., shaman totems), updated dual spec options, and lots of bug fixes
* Added a new feature: Headline View (Text-Only) as known from TidyPlates
  - TidyPlatesHub must be enabled for this to work; configure it via TidyPlatesHub profiles
  - Basic configuration options are available, see Nameplate Settings - Headline View (subtext settings are derived from nametext settings)
  - All Threat Plate widgets are disabled (auras, combo points, ...) - doesn't make much sense enabling them in this mode
* Added a new feature to enable automatic role detection based on the currently active spec (see options, Threat System, Spec Roles)
* Castbar border can now be set to Default or Thin (like healthbar border)
* Improverd layering of Threat Plates widgets and target name plate (which is often overlapped by other plates)
* Removed no longer supported localizations (translation support is welcome!)
* Fixed a bug where certain nameplate widgets were not updated after changes in the options dialog
* Fixed error with reload UI and AuraWidget
* Fixed HP bar colouring with NPCs
